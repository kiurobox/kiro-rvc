### Installation

Ensure that you have the necessary Python packages installed by following these steps (Python 3.9 is recommended):

#### Windows

Execute the [install.bat](./install.bat) file to activate a Conda environment. Afterward, launch the application using `env/python.exe rvc_cli.py` instead of the conventional `python rvc_cli.py` command.

#### Linux

```bash
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

### Getting Started

For detailed information and command-line options, refer to the help command:

```bash
python rvc_cli.py -h

python uvr_cli.py -h

python download_audio.py -h
```

This command provides a clear overview of the available modes and their corresponding parameters, facilitating effective utilization of the RVC CLI, but if you need more information, you can check the [documentation](https://rvc-cli.pages.dev/).
